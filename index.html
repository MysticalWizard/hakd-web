    <h1>Welcome to HakD!</h1>

    <p>HakD is a hackathon for everyone – people just like you, the person that sits next to you in history, and the other guy who is eating Pringles – yes, all of you are invited!</p>
    <p>Hackathons (contrary to teachers’ concerns) are not events that encourage people to become Neo and hack into the Matrix. Rather, they are about challenging yourself to push the fundamental boundaries of what you can truly create.</p>
    <p>For those who are new to programming, this is a great opportunity for you to try it out and see if it is something you would like to pursue in the future. For those who want to flex their skills in creating awesome products with others, this is also a great opportunity for you to meet new people that share the same passions as you!</p>
    <p>We are excited to give you the best possible experience and (hopefully) persuade you to follow the path of technology to infinity and beyond! </p>

        <p class="card-text">To sign up for HakD, speak to your local CS teacher or equivalent and get in a pair with someone from your school. When you arrive at the event, you will receive a swag bag full of HakD themed goodies! We will group your pair with another pair from a different school to form a team of 4 students.</p>

        <p class="card-text">On the first day of the event, you will participate in tech-related workshops! You will join the workshops and learn new skills like coding robots, hacking and building robots. If you're feeling tactical, you can coordinate which workshops to attend as a group so you can combine the knowledge from all the workshops in the next step!</p>
